# SQL-Udemy-Exercises

I took a Udemy course that discussed the basics of SQL including different kinds of data types, aggregation, joins, logical operators and syntax. One of the final exercises was to create a clone of Instagram's database and answer some relevant questions using SQL queries.

Below are the questions asked:

1. Find the 5 oldest users.
2. What day of the week do most users register on?
3. Find users who have never posted a photo.
4. Who gets the most likes on a single photo?
5. How many times does the average user post?
6. Find the top 5 hashtags.
7. Find users who have liked every single photo on the site.

The code that I used to answer said questions can be found in the 'Code' document in the repository.

The code that I used to clone the Instagram database can be found in the 'ig-clone-data.sql' document in the repository.
